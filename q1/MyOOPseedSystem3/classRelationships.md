# Class Relationships: Association and Multiplicity
## Previous Work
[Part I - Classes and Objects](https://github.com/mkssaltorio-stack/9siliconcs3/blob/main/q1/MyOOPseedSystem/classObjectUml.md)
[Part II - Class Attributes and Methods](https://github.com/mkssaltorio-stack/9siliconcs3/blob/main/q1/MyOOPseedSystem2/classAttributesMethods.md)
## Existing Class
Class: Pencil
Description: My class represents an object used for writing
## New Related Class
Class: Pencil Case
Description: This class represents an object used to store school supplies like: Pencil, Pen, Sharpener etc.
## Association
Relationship: Storage
Explanation: The pencil case can store the pencil inside it
## Multiplicity

Multiplicity: Many to One
Explanation: Because you can put an infinite amount of pencil depending on the size of the pencil case

## Analysis
### What is the association between your two classes?
### What multiplicity did you choose and why?
### How did you implement the relationship in Python?
### Why did you store an object reference instead of copying its data?
### If your relationship uses many, why is a list appropriate?
